Method resolution order:
In Python, every class whether built-in or user-defined is derived from the object class and all the objects are instances of the class object. Hence, the object class is the base class for all the other classes.
In the case of multiple inheritance, a given attribute is first searched in the current class if it’s not found then it’s searched in the parent classes. The parent classes are searched in a left-right fashion and each class is searched once.
If we see the above example then the order of search for the attributes will be Derived, Base1, Base2, object. The order that is followed is known as a linearization of the class Derived and this order is found out using a set of rules called Method Resolution Order (MRO).
